<h1 align="center"> Algorithms and DataStructures</h1>

This project is started with the intent of learning `algorithms and data-structures` as it provides base for
`interview preparation`. Anyone is free to add additional  `data structures` and improvise the content. I hope anyone 
out there who is preparing for the `big tech companies`, this repository may provide a little help to them in the future.

## what i felt important while doing this project ?
 whatever i do everything seems to be so mathematical. so along with this project i want to improve my
 math ability. so i started working on the below math areas as well.
 
  * Vedic Math for faster numerical computation
  * algebra
  * trigonometry
  * calculus
  * graph theory
  * probability and statics
  * geometry
  
  i know that these things can't be developed quickly, so i try to improve gradually, but at least i can scratch the 
  basics for my next interview.
   
## How do i plan to do this project ?
 
I thought of doing `data structures` first then `algorithm's` that are built on this `data structures`, but sometimes
i may randomly do some other things depending on the mood.

## How often do i update this project ?

I am currently not sure about it may be weekend days like (saturday's ,sunday's).

## How to import this project ?

I had built this project using _`intellij`_ editor. Anyone having _`intellij`_ should be able to download and import the 
project. Make sure that is java is installed and set correctly in your OS.

## How do i created this readme page ?

I follwed the syntax from this [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page. Check this link
to structure your own readme pages.

## intellij shortcuts?

* `CTRL + J` for list of available shortcuts. 
* `psvm` public static void main(String[] args) { }
* `sout` System.out.println()
