# Algorithms and DataStructures

This core java project is started with the intent of learning `algorithms and data-structures` as it provides base for
`interview preparation`. Anyone is free to add additional  `data structures` and improvise the content. I hope any one 
out there who is preparing for the `big companies` this repository may provide a little help to them in the future.
