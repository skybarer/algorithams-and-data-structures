# Algorithms and DataStructures

This core java project is started with the intent of learning `algorithms and data-structures` as it provides base for
`interview preparation`. Anyone is free to add additional  `data structures` and improvise the content. I hope any one 
out there who is preparing for the `big companies` this repository may provide a little help to them in the future.

## How do i plan to do this project ?
 
I thought of doing `data structures` first then `algorithm's` that are built on this `data structures`. 

## How often do i update this project ?

I am currently not sure about it may be weekend days like (saturday's ,sunday's).

## How to import this project ?

I had built this project using _`intellij`_ editor. Anyone having _`intellij`_ should be able to download and import the 
project. Make sure that is java is installed and set correctly in your OS.

## How do i created this readme page ?

I follwed the syntax from this [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page. Check this link
to structure your own readme pages.
