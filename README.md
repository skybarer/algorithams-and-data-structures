# Algorithms and DataStructures
This core java project is started with the intent of learning `algorithms and data-structures` as it provides base for
`interview preparation`. Anyone is free to add additional  data-structures and improvise the content. I hope any one 
out there who is preparing for the `big companies` may provide a little help in the future.

## How to import this project ?
I had built this project using _`intellij`_ editor. Anyone having _`intellij`_ should be able to download and import the 
project. Make sure that is java is installed and set correctly in your OS.
